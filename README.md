# ESP32 Samples
This repo contains a short list of ESP32 samples:
* ble
* wifi
* wifi_manager
* blink
* red_blue_web

There is a `run` file for each sample, showing how to run the `arduino-cli` command.

# Arduino Command Line Build

Arduino supplies a command line tool, `arduino-cli` to run builds for automation. An example use
of the command line tool would be to make periodic builds, e.g. nightly builds and for other
automation requirements. This produces the same binary as the Arduino IDE.

See `BUILD.sh` and `arduino-commandline.sh`
